    JAM FINDER
  ========
  Jam finder is an app for music lovers to last-minute find local events from new artists in a chosen price range and genre. Jam Finder works on a basic filtering system, pulling events from a seatgeek API and allowing the user to generate youtube videos of the chosen artist or band.
